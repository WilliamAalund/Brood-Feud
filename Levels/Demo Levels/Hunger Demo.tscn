WASD - move potion sprite
Meter - Satiation level, max value is 100
Godot - food object, touch it with player potion to restore satiation
Click button to restore hunger

- As long as any Area2D node that collides with the food object 
is in the \"eater\" group, the food will be eaten
- So to merge with another project, just import the assets and put whatever Area2D 
object is eating it in the \"eater\" group"
